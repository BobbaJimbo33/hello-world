# hello-world

Hi Split milk!

I like Machine Learning because it will make the future better. I would like to make the world a better place
so that our next generations can do things that are much more interesting like exploring the stars and not having 
to worry about all the problems. I wish to be part of making the change. I like working in groups however I've never
found good teammates. Except one time.
